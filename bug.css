The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}
```

In this example, both selectors target the `p` element. However, the `div p` selector is more specific because it targets `p` elements that are descendants of `div` elements.  The expected behavior might be for the `p` element to always be red, but due to specificity, the `div p` rule overrides the `p` rule when a `p` element is nested within a `div`. This can be unexpected if the developer is not aware of CSS specificity rules.

This can lead to unexpected styling if not handled carefully, especially in large and complex CSS projects.
